My name is Flemming Harms I’m a old school developer trying to keep up with the technology trend on the internet, and I have failed big time! 

Now that I have said it, I can talk about what my interest is. 

I’m a devoted Java EE developer and most of my work life I have been working with Enterprise software. I advocate open source and contribute back to various communities when time permits, and found out the best way to learn and get help is to give something back.

My blog post are centred around my experience I have encountered from my work life. Don’t expect my post is step by step guide, there is plenty other good blogs that is doing that. I try to keep my post short and typical followed by a short code example.

I typical divide my posts into 5 sections

* The goal is
* What did I found out
* The solution
* Where do I find the code.
* What did I learn

Happy coding :)
